					<h3> OIL PAINT</h3>
				</th>
				<th class="aboutusdetails">

					<body>Pigments and binders
						Oil colours consist mainly of pigments and binding agents. The binders of the oil paints are
						drying and semi-drying oils of plant origin, for example linseed oil, poppy seed oil, safflower
						oil and sunflower oil.

						The pigments used in artists’ oil colours are organic and inorganic, synthetic and of natural
						origin. The pigment palette consists of traditional as well as the most modern pigments
						available. The pigments used determine the colour shade, the opacity and the lightfastness of an
						oil colour. The quality of the raw materials used, the manufacturing process and the individual
						formulations determine decisively the quality of the resulting artists’ colour.</body>

					<h3>ACRYLIC PAINT</h3>
				</th>
				<th class="aboutusdetails">

					<body>Water-based acrylic paint is composed of pigment particles dispersed in an acrylic polymer
						emulsion. There are three main components in any acrylic paint - pigment, binder and vehicle:

						Pigment - pigments are granular solids which give paint its color. They are milled to a tiny
						particle size and do not dissolve, but remain suspended in the paint. Pigments can be organic,
						inorganic, natural and synthetic. They have little or no affinity for the surface to which they
						are applied
						Binder - a binder is the substance that keeps pigment in place after the paint dries. Acrylic
						paint has acrylic polymer as its binder and this forms a film after the water has evaporated
						Vehicle - this refers to the part of the paint that carries the pigment and binder. Water is the
						vehicle for water-based acrylic and when combined with the binder, it creates a polymer
						emulsion. Once the water leaves the system via evaporation or absorption, the paint dries,
						creating a stable clear polymer film full of trapped colored pigment particles</body>

					<h3>WATERCOLOR PAINT</h3>
				</th>
				<th class="aboutusdetails">

					<body>Watercolor paint is made of a few simple ingredients, but the two main components are the
						pigment (this provides the color) and the binder (usually gum-arabic). Watercolor paints also
						contain some other additives which alter the paint’s appearance, the way the paint performs, and
						to extend the shelf life of the product.

						First and foremost you have the very finely ground colored pigments. There are over 100 pigments
						used in artists watercolor paint. These can be natural or synthetic. Some of the natural
						pigments are hard to acquire, which makes certain colors more expensive. The quantity of pigment
						in the paint can also vary depending on it’s grade or quality. Most manufacturers offer two
						qualities of watercolor paints - professional grade or student grade. With student grade paint
						the cost is lower because some of the expensive pigments are replaced with moderately priced
						alternatives. The proportion of pigment in paint varies between 10% and 20%.

						The binder in watercolors is traditionally gum-arabic, but some brands use a synthetic binder.
						The job of the binder is to help the colored pigment attach and “bind” to the watercolor paper.
						The binder also helps produce a brighter color by holding the pigment particles together on the
						surface of the paper. Binder is a transparent substance and in general makes up about 50% of the
						paint.</body>

					<h3>GOUACHE PAINT</h3>
				</th>
				<th class="aboutusdetails">

					<body> Gouache paint (pronounced gw-ash) is similar to both watercolour and acrylic paint mediums.
						Much like watercolour, it’s a pigment that has to be mixed with water to allow it to spread
						across paper, canvas or any other surface.

						Gouache painting dates back to the 18th century, and at the time was used to create historically
						relevant and visually arresting works of art. Today gouache paint is often described by artists
						as an ‘opaque watercolour’, as the medium can be used with watercolour brushes, on watercolour
						paper, and applies in a very similar way. The only difference is in the sheerness, as when
						gouache is applied the paper beneath will not be as visible as it is when using traditional
						watercolours.

						Gouache is an underrated yet extremely powerful medium that you should definitely consider
						working into your style. If you want to learn more about how to use gouache then read on as
						we’ll be covering how you should use it and why you should use it to your artistic advantage.
