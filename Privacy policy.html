		To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide and improve Color Tree Services, we use

		Notice.<br>

		Does Color Tree Share Your Personal Information?<br>
		Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling
		our customers' personal information to others. Color Tree shares customers' personal information only as
		described below and with Color Tree.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries that Color Tree.com, Inc. controls that
		either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this
		Privacy Notice.<br>

		Transactions involving Third Parties: We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills
		provided by third-parties for use on or through Color Tree Services. For example, you can order products from
		third-parties through our stores, and download applications from third-party application providers from our App
		Store. We may also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses. You can tell when a
		third-party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those
		transactions with that third-party.<br>
		Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
		Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email,
		removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing
		search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content,
		scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers
		have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
		purposes.<br>
		Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services.
		In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains
		subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents
		otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Color Tree.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are
		acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.<br>
		Protection of Color Tree and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release
		is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use & Sale and other agreements; or
		protect the rights, property, or safety of Color Tree, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
		information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br>
		Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with
		third - parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.<br>

		How Secure Is Information About Me?<br>
		We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.<br>

		We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols
		and software.<br>
		We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.<br>
		We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and
		disclosure of customer personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask to verify your
		identity before we disclose personal information to you.<br>
		Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and loss of data. You can
		control these features and configure them based on your needs. Click here for more information on how to manage
		the security settings of your device.<br>
		â€¢ It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers,
		devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your Color Tree account that is not used for
		other online accounts . Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Click here for more
		information on how to sign off.<br>
		What About Advertising?<br>
		Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: Color Tree Services may include third-party advertising and
		links to other websites and applications. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you
		when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party
		advertising at Color Tree, including interest-based ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads notice. To adjust
		your advertising preferences, please go to the Advertising Preferences page.<br>
		Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you
		with more useful and relevant Color Tree ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or
		other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a
		cookie or other device identifier. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share
		your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app
		again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can
		learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the Advertising Preferences page.<br>
		What Information Can I Access?<br>
		You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, household
		settings, and purchase history in the "Your Account" section of the website. Click here for a list of examples
		that you can access.<br>

		What Choices Do I Have?<br>
		If you have any questions as to how we collect and use your personal information, please contact our Customer
		Service. Many of our Color Tree Services also include settings that provide you with options as to how your
		information is being used.<br>

		As described above, you can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take
		advantage of many of the Color Tree Services.<br>
		You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the What Information Can I
		Access? section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.<br>
		If you do not want to receive email or other communications from us, please adjust your Customer Communication
		Preferences. If you don't want to receive in-app notifications from us, please adjust your notification settings
		in the app or device.<br>
		If you do not want to see interest-based ads, please adjust your Advertising Preferences.<br>
		The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting
		new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
		block cookies altogether. Because cookies and other identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential
		features of Color Tree Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or
		otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or
		use any Color Tree Services that require you to Sign in. For more information about cookies and other
		identifiers, see our Cookies Notice.<br>
		If you want to browse our websites without linking the browsing history to your account, you may do so by
		logging out of your account here and blocking cookies on your browser.<br>
		You will also be able to opt out of certain other types of data usage by updating your settings on the
		applicable Color Tree website, device, or application. Most non-Color Tree devices also provide users with the
		ability to change device permissions (e.g. disable/access location services, contacts). For most devices, these
		controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to change your device
		permissions on devices manufactured by third - parties, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or
		your device manufacturer.<br>
		If you are a seller, you can add or update certain information in Seller Central, update your account
		information by accessing your Seller Account Information, and adjust your email or other communications you
		receive from us by updating yourNotification Preferences .<br>

		your personal information. If you wish to do any of these things, please visit here or contact Customer Service.

		Are Children Allowed to Use Color Tree Services?<br>
		Color Tree does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults.
		If you are under 18, you may use Color Tree Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.<br>

		Conditions of Use & Sale, Notices, and Revisions<br>
		If you choose to use Color Tree Services, your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and
		our Conditions of Use & Sale, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the
		laws of Egypt. If you have any concern about privacy at Color Tree, please contact us with a thorough
		description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change
		also. You should check our websites frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current
		Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises
		we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of
		customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.<br>
